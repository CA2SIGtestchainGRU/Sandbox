# Hyperledger Labs

Hyperledger Labs provides a space for development and testing

## Process to propose a new lab

1. Submit Proposal (Not Planned)
2. Sponsor (No)
3. Sponsors 
        a. the proposers can use their connections to existing projects and ask maintainers
        b. find working groups or projects with affinities to the proposed lab and pitch the project in associated channels and or mailing lists. The WG chairs emails, the maintainers contacts etc. can be found on the wiki or github.  
        
4. Commit your changes with proper sign-off. This means that your commit
log message must contain a line that looks like the following one,
with your actual name and email address:

        Signed-off-by: Peter C <peter.clarke@affineglobal.co.uk>

   Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command will add that line
automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit
log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.

5. Submit a Pull Request.

The labs stewards will not/ review your proposal.
